##Installation
First make sure you have MongoDB, Node, Npm, Bower and Grunt installed.
next clone the repo and use the 'npm install' command to install dependencies. 
Project uses sass and compass as well so you may need to install those.

###Starting the server
type 'grunt' in the command line

###Notable files
so far the only files really in use are server/app.js for the back end stuff and app/scripts/application.js for front end
